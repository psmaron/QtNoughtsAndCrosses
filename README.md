# QtNoughtsAndCrosses
This is a simple (and fast) implementation of "Noughts and Crosses" in QML without AI (only two players mode).  
  
The game indicates whose turn it is, what is the current player score, and shows who has won the current round (or whether it is a draw).   
  
Was done only to practice some QML.
